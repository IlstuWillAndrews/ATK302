    Carlos the Dragonfly is the main character in a 2d side scroller. <br>
    He uses his lazer eyes in order to destroy bad guys (which happen to be flies) as he manuvers around obstacles with his magnificent wings<br>
    Carlos has a special tail and legs that activate when he uses his lazer ability. <br>
    His tail glows blue and his legs extend when he fires the lazers creating an added challenge not to touch any obstacles<br>
    His tail also functions as a bomb dropper (which is a powerup available in the 2d side scroller)
